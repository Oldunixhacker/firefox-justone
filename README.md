# JustOne

A simple hack to remove tabs from Firefox, leaving you with the address bar. Designed
for **Firefox 82+**.

## Install

1. **Ensure "Title Bar" is enabled in the "Customize Firefox" menu!** Stuff will
   break with Firefox's CSD support.
2. Download repository ZIP and extract it (hint: to download ZIP, click "Code").
3. Go to `about:support` and click "Open Directory".
4. Move the `chrome` folder from the location you extracted to your Firefox profile.
5. **Restart Firefox.** (presss `Ctrl+Q` and then open Firefox again)

## Optional

* For a more retro experience, turn on "Menu Bar" in **Customize Firefox > Toolbars**.
